                <p>I'm a cognitive systems engineer and human factors researcher with a PhD from the University at Buffalo. My work focuses on <strong>how humans make decisions in complex, time-critical command and control environments</strong> and how the design of joint cognitive systems impacts operator performance in those domains. I am currently a senior systems engineer at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, where I build and deliver high-impact technical solutions to sponsor challenges that fall within my research interests.</p>
                <p>From my perspective, command and control is fundamentally about supporting human objectives accomplished via orchestration of domain-specific sociotechnical systems. Within those systems (which I think about as Joint Cognitive Systems, or JCS), I am interested operator strategies to coordinate action under uncertainty, manage information overload, and maintain situation awareness in time-pressured, safety critical domains. I start with the operators, understand their challenges from their perspective, and use empirical data collected about work in their domain to identify solutions that would directly improve the performance of the JCS. I then deliver tools that realize those solutions and improvements within the constraints of acquisition sponsor systems. You can learn more about what I do on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamhouserphd/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
                <p>Outside of work, I'm interested in building science, heat pumps, HomeAssistant, and other nerdy stuff. Also, coffee sometimes.</p>
