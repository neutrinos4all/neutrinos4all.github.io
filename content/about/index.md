This blog used to be about coffee. I graduated in June 2018 from the University at Buffalo, State University of New York, with a PhD in industrial and systems engineering. My research focused on discovering and refining methods for securing humans in complex digital systems through the synergistic use of concepts from human-systems interaction, human performance modeling, and systems engineering analysis. This work looked for unanticipated interactions between humans and systems, particularly where these interactions could unexpectedly put users or large information systems at risk. You can read about the results of these investigations on my [Publications page](https://appliedcaffeine.org/publications.html).

After graduating, I took a job at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. There I'm an R&D engineer involved with formal methods, human-machine teaming, and remote and autonomous surface vessels. I've been there ever since, and I've had a few different positions on both the "technical leadership" and "people management" sides. I enjoy both.
