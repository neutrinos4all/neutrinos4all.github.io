Summary: For those of you who would like to create a better-looking curriculum vitae for prospective employers, consider using moderncv. This tutorial will help you get started.</p>
<p>I have to admit, one of the principal reasons for building the site is to have a personalized space on the <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/4/2/11352744/ap-style-guide-will-no-longer-capitalize-internet">internet</a> that people (and potential employers) can use to get a sense of me as a potential employee. I can display some of my projects, talk about the work I do, and get some info about my interests. I used LinkedIn for a long time, but sometime ~2015 I realized it was becoming less useful for actual employer networking or job-searching. I recently decided I didn&rsquo;t want to use their service any more, made this site, and took down my LinkedIn profile. Maybe sometime I&rsquo;ll write more in-depth about it, perhaps once I&rsquo;ve been out of the service for a while.</p>
<p>Anyway, that meant I&rsquo;d need a proper <a href="https://www.ncfr.org/professional-resources/career-resources/general-career-resources/your-cv-it-vita-or-vitae">curriculum vitae</a>, or at least some written and preferably downloadable method for communicating details about my education, work experience, and qualifications. I had made a vita before, but I used Word and it showed. I knew a bit of LaTeX and I wanted to demonstrate what skills I had, plus maybe continue to work on them a bit, so I decided to make the entire CV with it.</p>
<p>I knew that I wanted to use a pre-canned template, vowing that some day I would write my own, eventually landing on <a href="https://www.ctan.org/pkg/moderncv?lang=en">moderncv</a>. It looked relatively good for being a standardized template and seemed easy to use. Once you download it (manually, through either your TeX editor or, if you&rsquo;re using Linux, through Synaptic), call the template at the very top of your .tex document:</p>
<pre><code>:::code
\documentclass[11pt,a4paper]{moderncv}
</code></pre>
<p>and you&rsquo;re off and running.</p>
<p>This tutorial won&rsquo;t focus on using the package, because you can currently find some <a href="https://walrustech.wordpress.com/tag/template/">helpful</a> <a href="https://fredrikloch.me/post/using-moderncv/">content</a> out there on its use&ndash;not to mention the actual <a href="https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~xdanaux/moderncv/trunk/view/head:/examples/template.tex">template,</a> which includes an extensive system of very straightforward comments. I don&rsquo;t want to re-hash their work. What I will spend a bit on, though, are the little improvements I made on it.</p>
<h3 id="typesetting">Typesetting</h3>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t like how the standard moderncv package rendered text, particularly because I didn&rsquo;t like how it handled kerning on larger-point fonts. I opted to use <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/EB+Garamond#charset">EB Garamond</a>, an open-source incarnation of the Garamond typeface family. Installed through the <code>texlive-fonts-extra</code> Linux package, I enabled it with:</p>
<pre><code>:::code
\usepackage{ebgaramond}
</code></pre>
<p>I also made use of small capital letters throughout my vita, particularly for section and subsection headings, becuase I thought it added a nice touch and slightly improved readability for text-heavy sections. It can be safely used throughout the template by calling <code>\textsc{your text here}</code> anywhere you&rsquo;d like to use it.</p>
<h3 id="relevant-coursework-bulleted-items">Relevant coursework bulleted items</h3>
<p>After I listed out all of my coursework with <code>\cvline</code> entries and rendered it, I decided it left too much negative space on the page. Putting my courses in a bulleted format would be a more efficient approach. The code I used for that section can be seen here:</p>
<pre><code>:::code
\section{\textsc{Relevant Coursework}}
\hspace{6.4em}
\begin{tabular}{p{.4\textwidth}p{.5\textwidth}}
    $\cdot$ Advanced Formal Methods Techniques &amp; $\cdot$ Human Factors Research Methodology\\
    $\cdot$ Cognitive Engineering &amp; $\cdot$ Human Information Processing\\
    $\cdot$ Cognitive Processes &amp; $\cdot$ Industrial Hygiene\\
    $\cdot$ Design and Analysis of Experiments &amp; $\cdot$ Java Programming I\\
    $\cdot$ Formal Methods in Human Factors &amp; $\cdot$ Ontology Engineering\\
    $\cdot$ Home Health Innovations &amp; $\cdot$ Sensing Realities\\
    $\cdot$ Human-Computer Interaction &amp; $\cdot$ Safety in Human Factors\\
\end{tabular}
</code></pre>
<p>It may take some custom tinkering on your part, but I&rsquo;ll provide a bit of explanation for the included commands:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>\hspace{}</code> adds horizontal white space, depending on the argument you give it inside the curly braces. The &rsquo;em&rsquo; unit label signifies an amount of horizontal space equivalent to an uppercase letter &ldquo;M&rdquo; in the font being currently used. As someone else told me, it&rsquo;s sometimes easier to visualize how large those differences are as opposed to points or millimeters.</li>
<li><code>{tabular}{p{.4\textwidth}p{.5\textwidth}}</code> sets the two columns in my table, as well as the portion of the page that each column will occupy given in a decimal fraction of the total &ldquo;text-occupiable space&rdquo; width. Here, the first column will take 40% of the width and the second will take 50%. If you left it at .5 and .5, you&rsquo;d notice that the righthand column was pushed a little too far over, a residual effect from modifying the <code>\hspace{}</code> parameter earlier. Reducing the size of the lefthand column will pull the righthand column over, the amount of which can be finely controlled by modifying the decimal value passed in.</li>
<li><code>$\cdot$</code> is just the LaTeX math symbol code used to render the bullets in my list. There are many ways to do it, but if you wanted to stick with a mathematical symbol check <a href="http://web.ift.uib.no/Teori/KURS/WRK/TeX/symALL.html">this</a> page for a quick reference.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tasteful-colors-and-formatting">Tasteful colors and formatting</h3>
<p>The rest is up to you, your particular tastes, and what you think would make for a professional-looking vita. Using a bit of color in sparing fashion can add a bit of style to your document, so long as it isn&rsquo;t too loud. LaTeX allows for an endless variety of customization and tweaking, so don&rsquo;t shy away from using its capabilities to your advantage.</p>
<p>As always, if you find mistakes or have questions, please send an email.</p>
