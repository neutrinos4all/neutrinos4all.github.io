      <p>Title: A new direction for this blog (Updated May 2023)
Date: 2021-01-01
Category: blog
Slug: a-new-direction
Tags: miscellaneous
Summary: With the new year, I&rsquo;ve been thinking about where this blog will go in the future. Below are some thoughts.</p>
<p>Now that I have a full-time job and am out of grad school, I have less time to devote to tinkering and writing about it. I&rsquo;ve consequently been thinking about where this blog should go in the future if I should choose to maintain it. Simultaneously, I&rsquo;ve grown more concerned about global warming, ecological preservation, and what I can do in my own space to have an impact (perhaps a small one, but an impact still).</p>
<p>My solution is to write about what I do on a path to reducing my ecological impact, saving energy around the house, and how what time I have left to tinker can work towards these solutions.</p>
<p>As I write about these topics, please send me an email using the link in the top menu with suggestions, corrections, or other things to consider. Watch this space for future updates!</p>
<p>[UPDATE: MAY 2023]
Since writing this blog post back in 2021, I&rsquo;ve undergone several significant life changes. I will hopefully have some more time in the future to make other updates, but I wanted to add an edit to say that this site is still alive and I continue to maintain it.</p>
